method: Summarization
prompt: |
  You are a helpful assistant. Your task is to summarize the context text that the user provides for better performance in a RAG system.
  Pay special attention to all the numerical information, especially those contained in tables.
  The summary does not necessarily have to contain all the numerical information, but from reading the summary, one should be able to tell what information are contained in the text.
  When you receive the context text from the user, ONLY output the summarized text WITHOUT any extra reasoning or prefix / postfix text.
